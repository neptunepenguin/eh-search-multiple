eh-search-multiple - adds a search mode for gallery tags


## Usage

The script (eh-search-multiple.user.js) adds a toggle button which can switch
into a search mode for tags.  In search mode, tagging is disabled and you can
select multiple tags in the tag pane.  The tagging field is also changed, and
it displays all tags that have been selected in the format used for tag
searching.

After selecting all desired tags you can edit the text field if needed and then
click the new "Search!" button (that is placed instead of the "Tag!" button).
The search is performed on the main page.  The state of the toggle is carried
across different galleries and page reloads by means of local browser storage.
